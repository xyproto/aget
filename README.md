aurtic
======

Deprecated
----------

Since the transition to AUR4, aurtic is just a git wrapper. This can be done just as well with a simple shell function. Therefore, I consider this project to be deprecated.

About
-----

Aurtic is written in Go and intended for use on Arch Linux.


Examples
--------

Download the ld-lsb package from AUR:

`aurtic ld-lsb`

Installation
------------

One way is to install it from AUR, another way is:

`go get github.com/xyproto/aurtic`
